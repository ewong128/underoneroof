Project blurb:
Under One Roof is a task-management app designed for roommates who want to organize their living habits efficiently. This tool helps roommates assign and distribute household chores, notify the household of upcoming parties and events, share class schedules and availability, and view all this information on a shared calendar. Additionally, users can create roommate agreement forms and invite others to join their roommate group. Unlike other apps, Under One Roof focuses on promoting a healthier and more organized roommate lifestyle through comprehensive chore management and event coordination.
